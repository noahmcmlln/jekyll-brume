This is going to be kind of a scattered post, so please bear with me.

First of all, though, despite some serious difficulties, I managed to pull through (with a great deal of help from Scott - thanks again) and actually submit my Sketchy Sketchy code!
There still exists a weird glitch where the on-screen text moves, but at this point I have to admit that my code is good enough for me.

On that note - dailies. I know that I've kind of screwed myself with the amount of dailies I left for myself to do at the end of the semester, but 1) I believe that I have enough time to complete all of them if I put my nose to the grindstone a little bit, and 2) I'm pretty confident that all of the dailies I have left are tasks that I am already familiar with in some capacity through other dailies. And so even though I haven't necessarily followed the intended workflow for the course (which I regret) I believe that I'm not totally fucked! Hooray!

As to [Hassan](hassana85.github.io) and I's Makey Makey project, I find myself agreeing with [Diana](http://dianarosenberger.github.io/blog/2016-04-06/week10post1.html) in terms of wishing not to disclose stuff about it. Let me just say that I keep find myself getting excited about where it's going (hopefully this post won't be *too* poignant if something goes horribly wrong tomorrow). I think that our project is achieving what I desire from pretty much every artsier project I do: an exact equilibrium between being smart and being stupid.

The same can be said about my final project, which I'm pretty dang excited about also.
