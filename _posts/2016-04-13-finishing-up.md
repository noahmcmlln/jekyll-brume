So, taking after [Courtney](http://courtneyhale.github.io/blog/2016-04-13/Semester-in-Review.html) and [Joe](http://joetorok.github.io/blog/2016-04-13/not-much-post.html), I'm gonna talk about things in pretty broad form tonight, considering that I haven't done much in the way of critical making/coding this week, aside from the design document for me and Hassan's weird game machine. Design document - well - *design* is a pretty interesting process, to be sure, and actually writing out how to construct our object proved to be a pretty interesting, and actually fun, process, one that I think is influencing the way that I'm starting to think about how Hassan and I should go about tackling that final project (of course, thanks to Hassan and Scott for a great deal of influence/collaboration). As a brief aside, the way that this course is structured is a really freeing thing for me; while I'm kind of used to completing final projects in a sweaty, overcaffeinated furor, the smaller scale of this final is actually enabling me to have fun with this. I'm getting excited, and the very idea of *that* is fucking exciting.

ON THE OTHER HAND - dailies have been a continued problem of mine; although I have been getting some work done on this front, the idea that I've let myself get behind on this stuff is, if nothing else, kind of disappointing on my part. This is a classic Noah pattern that I find myself falling into in circumstances like this - given the chance, I will totally let myself slack off on things like this until the last possible second. I'm trying to rectify this behavior now, by actually plodding away at the stuff, but at the end of the day I have to admit that my situation is really nobody's fault but my own.

I don't mean to end this on such a down note - I'm pretty sure I'm not in any real grade danger here, and this is a situation I can for sure get out of.

Also, this class has been fucking great.
