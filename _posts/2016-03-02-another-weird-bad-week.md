Even though this blog has been pretty full of me complaining about myself and my shitty work ethic/making excuses about why this or that hasn't gotten finished yet, I again find myself in much the same place this week as I had gotten to last week, i.e. [David](http://davidlnowak.github.io/blog/2016-03-02/post-week7-coding.html); minimal progress on dailies, not through struggle so much as weird lack of time. I've been out of town a lot, sick, working on other projects/exams, what have you. All of this nonwithstanding, the truth of the matter is I really need to just get my nose to the grindstone on this stuff. I still have time, certainly, but I've just made stuff harder for myself later on, which is never good (this kind of behavior usually leads to Noah's classic late-semester panic attack). But I'm trying to fix it, certainly. See y'all in open lab tomorrow!

Despite my procrastination, though, I can definitely see that learning code (at the very least learning Javascript) has been affecting the way that I approach and think about digital media. Video games, for instance, have become less opaque for me, and as such both more approachable and enjoyable. On the other hand, current new media titans (Facebook, Google, YouTube) have become even more confusing than usual; the technical construction of these sites is a new batshit facet of these sites to consider; in these situations I feel like a caveman being abducted by aliens, not even able to comprehend the most basic elements of the environment surrounding me. Nevertheless, I feel like with a small level of understanding of any field, one becomes curious to know more as well as quickly overwhelmed; I feel like, even though I haven't been learning all that much since I was actually in physical class, I have certainly been learning something.
